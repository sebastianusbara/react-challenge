**TODO List React** is a code challenge for frontend developer.

![TODO List App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2387508/141241010-f29cb52e-adcf-4ac3-a220-ad59f7661d54.png)

## Mission

**Here are the tasks you must complete:**

- Complete the TODO List application in accordance with the design (image above)
  - Fetch tasks
  - Add a new task
  - Delete a task
- **MUST** use [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (db.json) as API server when fetching tasks, adding a new task and deleting a task
- Implement custom hooks in order to manage tasks
- Add more than **3 unit tests** (custom hooks and components) with [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- Refactor the code to be more readable
- Add source code comments to be more readable

## Rules

**NOT ALLOWED**

- Remove existing source code
- Change the API server and `db.json`
- Use another languages like TypeScript (**MUST** use JavaScript)

**ALLOWED**

- Change the design to have better UI and UX
- Modify existing source code
- Create new modules/methods/components/hooks
- Add **new packages**

## Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn server`

Run the API server with JSON Server.
